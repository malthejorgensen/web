      <section>
        <h3>What is CHAOS?</h3>
        <p> CHAOS is a database for media content. CHAOS does not store the
        media itself but rather references (URLs) to the media. Furthermore
        <!-- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/176264/whats-the-difference-between-a-uri-and-a-url -->
        CHAOS can store rich metadata (XML) for each object. CHAOS allows
        controlled access to the media via a built-in user and folder system.

        The CHAOS database can be searched via its indexer (Solr).</p>

      <section>
        <h3>API versioning</h3>
        <p>
          The current version of CHAOS (as of March 2013) is v5.<br>
          Tutorials (including this introduction) can be assumed to be written
          for v5 unless otherwise noted.<br>
          CHAOS v5 was released in November 2012. The primary change from v4
          to v5 is that output is now guaranteed to be UTF-8.<br>
          v6 is currently in development.<br>
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
          <p>
          For v1-v5 there is no built-in way in CHAOS to obtain version
          information, and you have to know which version you are dealing with
          beforehand. In v6 the API will expose which versions are available.

        <h3>Objects, metadata and files</h3>
        <p>
        Each media reference in CHAOS is called an <code>Object</code>. Objects have a
          number of fields, of which the most important are <code>Files</code>
          and <code>Metadatas</code>.
          <ul>
            <li><code>Files</code> is a list of files (media URLs) associated
            with the object</li>
            <li><code>Metadatas</code> is a list of metadata (XML strings)
            associated with the object</li>
          </ul>
          An overview can be seen in the figure below.

        <p>
          Every metadata XML-document has a related metadata schema.

          Furthermore objects can have relations to other objects.

        <h3>Object retrieval and search</h3>
        <p>
          The CHAOS database is indexed in a Apache Solr index, and searching
          and general retrieval is done through this index.

          You then search The metadata fields of the objects in the database are
          specified by their GUID, so somefield_guid:searchstring

          searching in different fields can be combined with the AND and OR
          keywords and conditions can be grouped with parenthesis.

          Retrieving a single object can be done by "searching" on the GUID
          field: GUID:object_guid and multiple objects can be retrieved by
          combining guid searches: GUID:object1_guid OR GUID:object2_guid
